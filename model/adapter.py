"""Thin adapter over `tennis.engine` to feed a GUI.

Exposes `PointStream`, an iterator that yields one structured record per
simulated point, including server/receiver, serve side, winner, a terminal
reason for animation, and current scoreboard/bias as computed by the model.

The adapter consumes the underlying `simulate_match` generator to update
internal game/set/match state and server alternation (server starts as A and
alternates each game, mirroring the engine). The GUI should not re-decide
point winnersâ€”this stream carries the winner decided by the model.
